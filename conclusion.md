As Expected the dataset is left skewed, indicating that there are very few transactions that are of very high value. Most of the transactions are for small value purchases.

Above plot clearly shows that most of the transactions are for Food and Miscellaneous purchases.

Let's Analyse the top 4 categories and their percentage share as well

From the Above plot we can see that the April, January and August have the most number of transactions.

Another insight we get is that the months of June, September, October, November and December have a surprisingly low number of transactions

What are the monthly category wise transactions?

let's plot a stacked barplot to look at it

The trend of food being the biggest category of spending continues in every month.

Other than that another trend I see is that the amount spend for Shopping in April is largest, followed by November. The trend from november might be from the fact that Last Year Diwali was in November.

Let's see this trend more clearly by just ploting shopping transactions per month

What about Food Transactions?

Let's plot the food transactions per month:

They follow the same trend as the total number of transactions. It was expected as contributes to almost 62% of the total transactions.

Analysing the data for Weekend and Weekday Purchases
Is the spending more on Weekdays or on Weekends?

Surprising there are more purchases on weekdays then on weekends

One reason for this might be the fact that most of the transactions are for food and misc. Also this are transaction of a technology that has become very accessible. And daily purchases are almost always made by UPI payments. That is why number of transactions are more for weekdays than weekends

lets see this chart for food transactions and shopping transactions

#Going a step further, analysing the transaction frequency for each day of the week

So we can see that most number of transactions occur on Friday, followed by Sunday and Wednesday. The lease number of transactions occur on Tuesday. Although there is not much difference between the number of transactions. Therefore it is fair to conclude that the number of transactions are fairly distributed over each day.

Let's Analyse the same but now category wise

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e8abcb-69c7-4835-b481-127345d53226)

So we can see that most amount of shopping is done on Thurdays, followed by Sunday. Further Rent payment is also mostly done on Thursdays. And Salary is mostly paid on Mondays and Tuesdays.

Lastly Analysing the Average Monthly balance in the accountÂ¶
