## Project Overview

This project includes code for:

- Data manipulation and cleaning
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib

The goal is to analyze [describe dataset or problem] and present insights through various visualizations.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed, along with the following packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   (Make sure to have a `requirements.txt` file in your repository listing the dependencies)

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open and run the notebooks or scripts in the `notebooks/` directory.

   Alternatively, you can run the Python scripts directly using:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

   (Replace `script_name.py` with the actual script name)

## Example

Here's a quick example of how to use the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.set(color_codes=True)

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Basic data inspection
print(df.head())

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='column_x', y='column_y')
plt.title('Scatter Plot of Column X vs Column Y')
plt.show()
```

Replace `'data.csv'` with your actual dataset and `'column_x'`, `'column_y'` with the appropriate column names.

## Contributing
